# Webserver in Go

This is an example of a Webserver in Go

## Objective

Made this small project in order to solidify knowledge in web dev. 
This repository implements what it could be a clone of Twitter but renamed as chirps.

#Features

I implemented authentication with JTW, using refresh tokens to refresh the access tokens. 
Some of the endpoints are restricted to users that are logged in and have a valid token.
Users can also create these chirps and retrieve them by Author or simply by the time they were posted.
